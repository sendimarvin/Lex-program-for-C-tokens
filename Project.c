/* In this Group Assignment, you are supposed to write a lex file with regular expressions, that will
    will be able to recognise all the tokens defined in this code, print how many tokens identified
    in a classified manner. An example if the tokens identified are identifiers how many are they,
    if they are operators, how many are they? etc. 
    Also if there are errors let the regular expression be in position to identify them.
    
    Then after write a context free grammar that can realize the tokens generated by the lexical Analyzer.
    
    You are supposed to present this work two weeks from today 3/22/2018 that will be 6th/04/2018
